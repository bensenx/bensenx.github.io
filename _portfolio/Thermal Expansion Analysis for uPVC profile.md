The coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CTE, a, or a<sub>1</sub> ) is a material property that is indicative of the extent to which a material expands upon heating. Different substances expand by different amounts. Over small temperature ranges, the thermal expansion of uniform linear objects is proportional to temperature change.

In this analysis, a sample Aluplast uPVC profile with 19 Feet length was chosen to simulate the temperature range from 40 F to 120 F.
