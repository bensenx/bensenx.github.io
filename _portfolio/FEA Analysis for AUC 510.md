The design should be driven by reliable calculation based on simulation. By implementing the Finite Element Analysis, we can tell
the better way of strengthening the profile. There are two primary methods to improve the tension pressure performance of a profile, by adding thickness for the end wall or side wall. The FEA analysis shown for profile AUC 510, both methods have similar improvement on the performance, but considering the cost adding up the end wall thickness would be a better choice. This document shows how is the conclusion been made.
