The standard European style French casement window only have one operable handle, the slave panel is normally control an inferior handle on corner element. In some cases, the customer may eager to have a French casement window with both side operable for a better look and easier access.

This article aims at providing a detailed instruction on how both-handle operable French Casement could be manufactured based on the normal 4000 Aluplast profiles and hardware from Maco.

The general concept of this new configuration is identical with normal French casement, but instead of false mullion gear drive, a regular gear drive would be applied in the gap between false mullion and the slave panel sash. With the regular gear drive in the slave panel, the sash could normally operate as usual tilt and turn handle. But it will also result in several issues. Our employees creatively solve them as following:

1. The regular gear drive is conflict with false mullion
The gap between the false mullion and slave sash is not enough for the sash lifter and cam in a regular gear drive. Therefore, in order to install the gear drive into the gap. Our employees dismantle the lifter and cam to make it compatible.

2. Security reduction since the handle side cam does not work
In the original theory design, no false mullion drive gear would been used in the both-operable configuration, which results no activate cam in the shared side of both sashes. In the new configuration, our employees make use of the false mullion gear drive with two additional end piece to provide the striker that could work with the cam in mater sash. In this way, no security reduction in the new configuration.

3. Conflict of false mullion installation screw
Several long bolts (quantity based on sash rebate height) were used to hold the false mullion with slave sash. In the new configuration, regular gear drive was mounted in the gap between false mullion and slave sash, which occupied the space for bolts. In the new configuration, the bolts were installed with an inclined angle inward or outward to mount false mullion to the slave sash.

4. Without mishandling Device
The new configuration will allow both panel compatible with tilt function, but the sash lifter is removed the window could not restrict the tilt function when the window is open.
