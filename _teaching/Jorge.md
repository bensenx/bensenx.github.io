Jorge is our assembler for our mullion station. Having only joined us a few short months ago, Jorge is the newest addition to our team, but his work ethic and versatility within our facility wouldn’t show it. He is a quick learner, and has yet to say “no” to anything he has been tasked with. In fact, I seriously doubt that word exists in his vocabulary. Jorge has been a contributing member to many aspects of our product’s assembly, and can move from task to task with ease. His reliability and accountability make him a valuable addition to our team.
