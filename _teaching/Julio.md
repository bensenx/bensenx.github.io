Julio is our machine operator for the glazing bead cutter. He specialized in profile bending for arched window and door units before joining our team, and that knowledge has proved Julio as a unique addition to us. Within a short period, he has established himself as a leading contributor for door assembly, and has been a part of the teams that have accomplished configurations that have never been done before.
