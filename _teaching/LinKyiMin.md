A very special thanks to Lin, for continuing to provide his support and service to our facility. Lin has helped us keep our inventory organized, and always provides his service with a smile. He is tasked with maintaining par levels for all the facilities, and Iâ€™m sure he can say Eurotek is the best one. He offers himself when an issue comes up, and works diligently to come up with solutions to help expedite our production. Thank you for your help, sir.
