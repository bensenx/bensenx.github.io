Gerardo is our assistant machine operator at the BJM station. Along with continuously training at this position, he has assisted in a variety of duties within our facility; he has improved greatly at glazing, he can operate the glazing bead cutter, assist with profile picking/ prepping reinforcements, and has assisted at the welding station. He always asks questions when tasked with something he is not entirely familiar with, which is a quality that demonstrates his eagerness to learn and grow into more responsibilities. He is notably the youngest member of our team, and has applied himself to task; with the guidance of the diverse team that surrounds and supports him, we are confident in his abilities to establish himself as a well-rounded and knowledgeable individual within our facility.
