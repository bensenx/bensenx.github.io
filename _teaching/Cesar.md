Cesar is our assembler for our hardware station. He has only recently assumed this role, but his willingness to learn and his innate curiosity to find out how things work make us confident that he will master this station. He always keeps himself busy, and makes himself available to help wherever help is needed, without hesitation. He gets along very well with his peers, and has demonstrated his abilities in multiple areas within our facility. It is this versatility and willingness to take on any challenge that makes Cesar a valued member of our team.
