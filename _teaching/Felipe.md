Felipe Castillo is our forklift. All joking aside, Felipe leads our glazing station. As the most proficient glazer on our team, Felipe consistently sets the bar for glazing takt time. We are proud to commend his progress, as he has come a long way in his work ethic and teamsmanship. He always makes himself available to help his fellow peers, and takes pride in maintaining his station well stocked and efficient. Felipe is loyal and honest, and if he believes in your goal and intention, he will fight beside you tirelessly.
