Mini-ZEPH stands for "Mini Zero Energy Passive House". This project was designed by architect Joe Giampietro, Principal at Nicholson Kovalchick Architects, and built by students at the Seattle Central College Wood Technology Center.

The Mini-ZEPH modular home is built to a high energy conservation standard, using a triple pane IG configuration for the windows which feature a combination of Cardinal's LoE-i89, as well as LoE-180 coated glass to meet the project's ambitious energy efficiency demand.

The LoE-180 glass amplifies the sun's radiant heat into the living space, while the LoE-i89 reflects heat back into the living space. Combined with Eurotek's air-tight and energy efficient window system, it provides an optimal heating solution for this Zero Energy Passive House in the Pacific North-West's much colder climate.
