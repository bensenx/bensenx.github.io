57 Wheeler is located in downtown Arcadia, near the Metro Gold Line. It is the first Mixed-Use development in the City, and is LEED certified for sustainability. The 4- story building offers 38 residential living units between floors 2-4, and will offer retail and office space on the ground floor.
This project is home to many combination window-and-door configurations constructed from wood-textured black/brown finished material; many of which, additionally, are arched. These complex configurations, matched with large unobstructed openings within the same frame make for a stunning glazed façade, and offer a metropolitan view from its south-facing living units, and a landscape view of the San Gabriel Mountains for its North-end inhabitants.
