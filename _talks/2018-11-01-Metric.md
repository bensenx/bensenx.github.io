The Metric Hotel project is located in a rapidly growing portion of Downtown Los Angeles, within minutes from many iconic landmarks such as Pershing Square, the Staples Center, The LA Convention Center, and LA Live to name a few. The Metric Hotel is a contemporary alternative to the large-scale corporate hotels that predominately surround the area. It offers luxury at an affordable cost and current technology with an efficient design to young, savvy travelers.
The Metric Hotel boasts a sleek, modern steel and glass façade. Minimal obstructions within large openings offer panoramic views of the bustling Downtown Los Angeles city-scape. Triple-pane IG configurations using Cardinal’s LoE 366 coating were chosen for this project, which underlines the intent on innovation and efficiency behind this project. The IG configurations used for this project achieve an industry-leading 0.15 U-factor; an achievement which has garnered Eurotek Windows & Doors the “Energy Star Most Efficient 2018” designation, which recognizes the most energy efficient products and represent the leading edge in energy efficient products this year.
