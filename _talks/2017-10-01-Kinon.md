Kin On is an assisted living apartment complex with access to dining, help services, and wellness programs. Adjacent to the Kin On Rehab & Care Center, these assisted living apartments are conveniently located near the Kin On Community Center, which hosts daily Healthy Living Classes and social activities for the community.
Residents have access to dozens of activities, classes, services, and meals right where they live. The apartments are designed to accommodate aging residents with special amenities, such as easy-access bathtubs, support bars on walls, and state-of-the-art design features that make mobility safer and easier.
